1. What is the Big O for this?

  1) O(1)
  2) O(n)

2. Even or odd

  O(1)
    input a number, get an output

3. Are you here?

  O(n^2)
    Nested loop

4. Doubler

  O(n)
    It is directly proportional to size (n) of input. It goes through each item of the array once.

5. Naive search

    O(n)
      Goes through array until finds item in array

6. Creating pairs   

    O(n^2)

7. Compute the sequence

    Fibonacci sequence - nth number is sum of the previous two numbers
    O(n^2)

8. An efficient search

    O(log(n))

      The more you go through the search, the smaller the array gets

9. Random element

    O(1)
      Input number and get output

10. What Am I?

    Checks to see if the number is prime
    O(n)
